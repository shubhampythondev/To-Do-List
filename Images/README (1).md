# ToDo List

A ToDo List is a web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize tasks or items they need to complete. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, delete tasks, and possibly edit existing tasks. The ToDo List typically consists of a simple user interface where tasks are displayed in a list format with checkboxes or buttons to mark them as completed.
